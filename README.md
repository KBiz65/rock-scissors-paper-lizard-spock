## Summary

I love the show The Big Bang Theory and have always loved playing Rock, Paper, Scissors. When I saw Sheldon (the main character on the show) describe his version of the game I knew I needed to build it. I had wanted to create for quite some time but never felt I had the skills to do so since I didn't feel comfortable with Javascript. I knew it was a vital language for any developer to learn but for some reason I resisted.

I've quickly learned how powerful and fun Javascript can be! Once I started delving more into manipulating documents and was able to interact with the browser, as opposed to simply showing stuff on a screen, I decided to jump into creating this app.

I ended up writting this app in just under a week. Although I ran into a few problems with the DOM, this app really helped me understand it on a much deeper level. I now feel much more comfortable creating, removing, and modifying elements.
